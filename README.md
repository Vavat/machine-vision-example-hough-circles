Core code that finds circles in an image in order to accurately locate tips for liquid handling robot.

Code would explain what is happening much better than any description that I can muster. The code is escessively commented specifically in order to leave no ambiguity about what is happening.  
A lot of the code is redundant to actually finding the circles, but is rather helpful in finding bugs. Example, code modifies original image with location and coordinates of the circles that were found.
